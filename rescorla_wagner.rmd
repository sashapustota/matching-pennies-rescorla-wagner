# Info on the model - notes
The "choice" object is part of the model's input data. It represents the actual choices made by subjects in each trial, as observed in the dataset. These are real-world observations that the model is trying to understand and predict.

"choice_sim", on the other hand, is a simulated output generated by the model. It represents hypothetical choices that could be made by subjects under the same conditions, based on the parameter values estimated by the model. These simulated choices are generated after the model parameters have been estimated, using the stochastic processes defined in the generated quantities block.

The "choice" data is used to fit the model. It's part of the observed data against which the model parameters (alpha and tau) are estimated. The model tries to explain these observed choices based on the underlying decision-making process it represents.

"choice_sim" is used for prediction and validation. After the model parameters have been estimated, choice_sim can be generated to simulate how the model believes subjects would behave under similar conditions. This can be useful for model validation (comparing simulated choices to actual choices not used in fitting the model) or for predicting future behavior under hypothetical scenarios.

Before fitting the model to the data, let's do a prior predictive check, to ensure our priors are adequate.

```{r}

library(rethinking)

alpha_prior <- runif(1e4 , 0, 1)
dens(alpha_prior)

tau_prior <- runif(1e4, 0, 10)
dens(tau_prior)

# As the 'rethinking' package messes up with fitting the STAN model to the data in the next chunk, we unload it.
pacman::p_unload(rethinking)

```


### If you want to run the model just once, use this chunk (otherwise see recovery chunks further down)
```{r}
modelFile <- 'RW.stan'

# Setting specs for modelling
nIter     <- 2000
nChains   <- 4

# Timing statements

startTime = Sys.time(); print(startTime)
cat("Calling", nChains, "simulations in Stan... \n")

# Fitting model
fit_rl <- stan(modelFile, 
               data    = data, 
               chains  = nChains,

# Some notessssss from methods 4
When conducting a prior-posterior check, we wanna see how the data (evidence) has updated our initial beliefs (priors) to give  new beliefs (posteriors). The extent and nature of this update can give insights into the parameter's role in the model and how it relates to the observed data. It's also important to reflect on whether the posterior distributions make sense given our understanding of the process being modeled. If the posteriors are surprising or counterintuitive, it may warrant a deeper examination of both the data and the model's structure..

### Prior-Posterior checks interpretation:
Informative data: The shift from the prior to the posterior distributions in both parameters indicates that our data is informative and is significantly updating our beliefs about the parameters.

Model fit: The lack of overlap between prior and posterior for tau suggests that the data has provided substantial information to update the beliefs about this parameter.

Conclusions: The model has learned specific characteristics about the learning rate and the temperature parameter from the data, which can be interpreted in the context of the behavior or process we are modeling.
